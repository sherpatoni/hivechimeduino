# hivechimeduino
Arduino code for HiveChime

The current version 8.3 works on the complete shield with RTC, ESP-wifi, SD card (mini card) and the sensor boards with independent LED power set up.

It works but much to be improved:
- clean up code
- add some power saving management
- add TCP connection for full data
- etc...
